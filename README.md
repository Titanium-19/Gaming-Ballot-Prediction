# Gaming-Ballot-Prediction

This research paper delves into the voting behavior across various counties in the US, employing 
an in-depth analysis to evaluate the performance of five distinct prediction models to forecast the 
results of a gaming legalization vote. Employing the KNIME data analytics platform for the 
analysis, the provided dataset was preprocessed, and prediction models were constructed using 
decision trees, random forests, artificial neural networks, logistic regression, and Sector Vector 
Machines. 

The results of the analysis showed that the neural network model surpassed the other models in 
accurately predicting the outcome of the gaming legalization vote. Furthermore, the study delves 
into the influential factors shaping voting behavior, encompassing demographic (PCI, population 
density and size of county) and economic (unemployment rate, poverty level and medium family 
income) elements among others. In the context of gaming legalization, the study identifies certain 
variables like percentage of white population and number of churches as pivotal in projecting 
ballot turnouts. Industries aiming for legalization should prioritize addressing these variables to 
bolster their prospects of success. 

The research provides a comparative evaluation of the prediction models and based on their 
sensitivity performance, the neural network model emerging as the most effective, followed by the 
random forest and decision tree models. These insights offer valuable guidance to policymakers, 
stakeholders, and decision-makers in the gaming industry, shedding light on the interplay between 
different models and influencing factors in predicting voting outcomes. This study not only 
contributes a rigorous analysis of voting behavior and prediction model performance but also 
offers actionable insights that can empower policymakers and industry stakeholders to make 
informed decisions in the realm of gaming legalization.
